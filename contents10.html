            One can easily become homesick during their stay on Antarctica. After all, it is the most extreme, desolate continent on planet Earth. Flights operating in and out of Antarctica happen at most, twice a week. Even then, it is important to be prepared mentally and physically for staying at Antarctica.
            <br><br>
            There are plenty of activities and pastimes to partake in during your stay to avoid boredom and homesickness. Most base stations have libraries, gyms, game rooms, media rooms, and at least one bar for all expeditioners to release steam and relax for a bit. Since the internet coverage is slow and prioritized to those doing work, base camps have plenty of DVD’s and pre-downloaded music, books, and other media content to keep you busy. 
            <br><br>
            A great way to keep your mind off of missing home is to burn off some steam. Exercise is a great way to keep your mind busy and your body active. After all, you will be spending some time on the continent, so it’s a great time to achieve your body goals.
            <br><br>
            Bars do exist in Antarctica, and in most base camps, alcohol is allowed. Many times during the year, programs and bases will host social events and gatherings. Most events have themes and are designed to allow social interactions between expeditioners who otherwise may not get to meet all the people staying with them during the season. 
            <br><br>
            If you are feeling homesick, it is possible to arrange a flight back to another country, but it may be expensive and not always possible to alter your set itinerary. If you are visiting during the winter season, good luck. It is incredibly rare for flights to take off unless it is a medical life-or-death emergency.
            <br><br>
            You may also choose to talk to psychiatrists and other help hotlines during your stay. Antarctic bases provide resources and numbers of professional help from nearby continents and countries, such as Australia.
