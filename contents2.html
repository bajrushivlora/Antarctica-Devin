            Antarctica operates on only two seasons: summer and winter. The summer season begins in October and ends in March. The winter season begins in April and ends in September. Most tourists visit Antarctica during the summer months simply because of the favorable weather and long hours of daylight. However, visiting Antarctica also depends on what you’re looking to see during your visit. For example, if you’d like to witness the Antarctic whales, the best time to travel would be in February and March, towards the end of summer. 
            <br><br>
            Travel during the winter months becomes more difficult and less favorable due to the harsh weather conditions and constant darkness. However, the winter season does offer the chance to see exciting wildlife, such as the Antarctic Emperor penguins. There is limited transportation going in and out of Antarctica during the winter time, even between base camps. So, if you decide to stay for the winter, be prepared to commit seven to nine months of stay on Antarctica with no way out. The reason for the limited transportation is, of course, due to the cold weather. For example, the U.S. Antarctic Program does not fly over the continent during the wintertime due to the cold temperatures at which gasoline from the plane fuel freezes.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, it is best to plan your visits or stays during the summer months. Know what you are looking to see during your visit and plan accordingly if you are brave enough to want to stay during the winter months.
