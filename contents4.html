            Depending on where in the world you are visiting from, Antarctica is a relatively easy place to visit in terms of visas and passports. Antarctica is not owned by a single country, therefore no visa is required. However, visitors and tourists must show proof of permission as per the Antarctic Treaty. This permission is provided by the country, and if you are visiting Antarctica through a tour operator, this will usually be taken care of. If you are partaking in a private expedition, the Antarctic Treaty requires that you and your group notify your country three months before your intended travel date.
            <br><br>
            If you are travelling through at least one other country during your journey to Antarctica, you must hold a valid passport. Once you arrive on Antarctica, it is important to note that there are no embassies operating by any country on the continent. If in any case you misplace or damage your passport or any other travel document, you must plan to contact the embassy of the next country on your itinerary.
            <br><br>
            In terms of health requirements, there are currently no vaccinations required to visit Antarctica. However, you must have some form of travel insurance before your visit. If you intend on staying for the winter season, you must have a very clean bill of health. You must provide dental x-rays, numerous blood test results, and several other health records that prove you have been in good physical and mental well being for at least the past two years. Healthcare on Antarctica is basic, with a few physicians and dentists, x-ray and ultrasound machines, and life-support devices. You must also prove that you will be able to maintain mental stability for the long duration of time that you are staying during the cold, dark winter months.        </p>
