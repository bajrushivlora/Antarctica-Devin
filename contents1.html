                    <br>
                    Antarctica has been coined the most mysterious continent on planet Earth. About 98% of Antarctica is covered 
                    in a large ice sheet. Aside from being covered in ice, Antarctica’s extreme climate and uninhabited land has 
                    made it a place for exploration and research by scientists, and strikes curiosity in those brave enough to 
                    brace the continent’s extremities. 
                    <br><br>
                    It is the southernmost continent, home to the South Pole. Antarctica’s cold, extreme climate renders the 
                    continent uninhabitable for the most part, aside from the seasonal scientists that 
                    visit Antarctica for research purposes. Its high altitude results in year-round cold temperatures, averaging
                     about -74 degrees fahrenheit at higher elevations. Not only is the weather extremely cold, but it is also dry 
                     and windy. Rain and snow are not common on the continent, in fact, Antarctica averages about two inches of 
                     precipitation every year. However, the strong winds can carry the dry snow and become Katabatic winds. Katabatic 
                     winds are a type of dangerous wind storm, where wind descends onto the ground, picking up snow and dry, cold air 
                     with it. These wind storms can reach over 150 mph, and can last for days, making it difficult for people to leave 
                     their base camps. 
                     <br><br>
                     Antarctica has two seasons, summer and winter, each lasting for six months. During the summer, 
                     the sun rises and does not set until the end, resulting in constant sunlight. Conversely, during the winter, 
                     the sun sets and does not rise until the end, producing constant darkness.  
                     <br><br>
                     Antarctica no singular national 
                     representation, nor does it have a native human population. However, thirty countries have research and scientific
                      associations to Antarctica, having signed the Antarctic Treaty. The treaty ensures that each country conducts 
                     research and scientific work without disturbing its environment and wildlife. Furthermore, it states that nations 
                     may not use Antarctica as a place for military bases, weapon testing, or other experiments of violent nature. 
                     <br><br>
                     There are currently forty-five research base camps scattered throughout Antarctica. These stations host thousands of 
                      people during the summer and winter seasons. Scientists and researchers conduct work on meteorology, geology, 
                      astronomy, and wildlife through observing Antarctica’s pure, untouched resources. 
                      <br><br>
                      Whether you are looking to 
                      research the depths of Antarctic land and wildlife, or you are intrigued by the extremities of this mysterious 
                      ice mass, Antarctica has a place for you. Brace yourselves, as there is a lot to learn before commencing your journey.
