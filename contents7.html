            Adjusting to life on Antarctica can be difficult, but it is possible. Taking showers and using the bathroom are tasks that are so well-ingrained in our routines that we donâ€™t question them. However, conducting these tasks in a new environment introduces a learning curve. So, how does one take care of themselves while on the continent ?
            <br><br>
            Well, living on Antarctica is often compared to living in a college dorm. At base camps, there are dorms for sleeping quarters, and the bathrooms are shared by roommates. These bathrooms have flushable toilets, public showers, and sinks with running water. However, showers should be taken as quickly as possible to save water and reduce electricity needed to heat the water. Should you be located at a camp without running water and proper bathrooms, you may need to resort to heating water in a pot for bathing. Most camps have portable, flushable bathrooms available in walking distance. It is always best practice to bring along wet wipes and other hygienic products in case you are ever in a situation where a shower is not readily available to you.
            <br><br>
            There may be some instances where you are not able to access a bathroom or flushable toilet. For example, you may be stuck at a base with no bathrooms or you are outside on an expedition and need to use the bathroom. In these instances, you are most likely going to use a make-shift toilet. These toilets are ice holes dug into the ground, where one squats and does their business. The waste is collected safely as to not introduce waste and harmful bacteria into Antarctic water. For going #1, many expeditioners recall using pee bottles to collect urine until they return to a location where they can properly dispose of it.
