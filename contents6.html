            Traveling to one of the coldest, most extreme continents in the world calls for wearing the warmest gear you have. The worst thing one could do is not bring enough warm layers with them on their journey. In addition to clothing, bring along items you will need for hygiene, making memories, and a few personal items to remind you of home.
            <br><br>
            Dressing up in Antarctica requires dressing in layers and outer gear. Make sure to pack clothing that are made out of moisture-wicking, breathable material. Such material can be wool, polyester, or nylon. Avoid cotton as it traps moisture and takes a long time to dry. Here’s a clothing check-list for help: 
            <br><br><br>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;" 
            -Undergarments<br>
            -Socks<br>
            -Sweaters<br>
            -T-shirts<br>
            -Leggings<br>
            -Pants<br>
            -Fleece jacket<br>
            -Outer coat<br>
            -Gloves<br>
            -Hats<br>
            -Scarves<br>
            -Sunglasses<br>
            -Ski mask<br>
            </span>
            <br><br>
            Aside from clothing, make sure to pack items you will use for hygiene. Such items should be used for showering, oral care, skin care, hair care, and more. Make sure to only bring the essentials, but don’t make the mistake of underestimating what you will actually need. 
            <br><br>
            In terms of items you will be using during your expedition, make sure to bring plenty of memory-capturing devices. Cameras, recorders, and mobile devices are great items to bring along with you. Be sure to pack necessary cables and chargers, and bring plenty of back-up batteries. While you’re at it, bring along binoculars- you never know when you’ll need them !
            <br><br>
            Lastly, bring a few key items that remind you of home. Whether it be photos or a favorite t-shirt, you will never know when homesickness will arise ! Being on a continent so distant from another human-habited place will surely make you miss home. Having these items will ease your mind and help you stay connected to home.
