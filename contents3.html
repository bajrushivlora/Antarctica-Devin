            If one wishes to see Antarctica, there are two ways: you can visit as a tourist, or apply for a job during the summer or winter seasons. As a tourist, there are plenty of cruises and tour packages available. However, it can become incredibly expensive, costing you anywhere from $5,000 to $25,000 for as much as a week. 
            <br><br>
            Since it is expensive to visit as a tourist, most people are able to visit Antarctica by getting a job. The base camps host plenty of opportunities for year-round jobs. If you are interested in research and science-based jobs, consult your country’s Antarctic research program, if there is one. If your country does not have an Antarctic program, it may be hard to navigate from there. However, keep in mind that certain jobs are not sponsored by these programs. For example, the U.S. Antarctic program does not sponsor jobs related to photography, sight-seeing ,or  recreational activities simply because these jobs are not seen as providing contribution to the advancement of Antarctic research. Be prepared to have skills in engineering or any specialized science, a lengthy resume, and any skills that set you apart from other candidates. 
            <br><br>
            If you still want to have a job but aren’t interested in science or research, research base camps are always looking for ad hoc jobs. For example, these opportunities can vary from sous chefs, janitors, electricians, to hair dressers. Most of these jobs are offered during the summer months, whereas the research based jobs are both during the summer and winter. However, only around 25% of the summertime employees stay for the winter months.
            <br><br>
            Do your research: there are plenty of agencies and websites posting paid job opportunities in Antarctica. Find what works for you, and be prepared to dazzle the employers with a stellar resume, job experience, and a passion for the continent.
