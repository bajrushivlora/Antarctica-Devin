            There are several ways to get to Antarctica from different parts of the world. Provided that Antarctica is the southernmost continent, travel would commence from the continents of South America, Australia, and Southern Africa. South America is the best point to depart and arrive from as it is the closest to Antarctica. If you are located in America or Europe, flying to South America would be the easiest method, whereas natives of Western countries would be better off flying to Australia or Africa. The two main methods of getting to Antarctica are by ship and by plane.
            <br><br>
            If you choose to take a ship into Antarctica, there are ports on different continents that arrive at different points on Antarctica. Most cruise ships depart from South America, in particular ,the Ushuaia port in Argentina and Punta Arenas in Chile. If you depart from Ushuaia, the journey will be 2 to 3 days to reach the Antarctic peninsula. Ships depart quite rarely from Punta Arenas, therefore it is recommended to stick to Ushuaia port for arrivals and departures. 
            <br><br>
            Ports in Australia and New Zealand offer ship journeys to the Eastern Antarctic peninsula, which is far more remote and rugged. This route would be more suitable if you are looking to see more wildlife and rugged terrain. From New Zealand, you can depart from Port Invercargill, and from Australia, you can depart from Port Hobart. However, these routes take far longer than the ports in South America, taking about 7 days to reach the Eastern Peninsula.
            <br><br>
            If you are looking to fly into Antarctica, one can take a charter plane from Australia, South Africa, and South America. Flights from Australia are very expensive and do not happen often. Flying from Argentina or Chile will take you to the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica, Union Camp, and the South Pole. In addition, flights from Cape Town will land at the South Pole.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, flying to Antarctica is more of a luxury, as it will run anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000. Most flight expeditions are fly-around, meaning they only tour the peninsula from the sky and do not make actual landings. Few of these flights land on the Antarctic peninsula and expeditions last for about a week. Taking a boat or cruise will prove to be more cost-efficient, but depending on where in the world you depart from, may be a rough journey. Crossing the Drake Passage between South America and Antarctica is a difficult and dangerous journey especially during inclement weather.
